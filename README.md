# calculatorStarterCode

This project was made as calculator.

You can chose from:

    *Addition
    *Subtraction
    *Division
    *Multiplication
    *Powers
    *Square Root
    *Logs (Base 10)
    *Generates Random Number 

This project takes two intergers and preforms the function that you have chosen. 

    *First you have to enter a number
    *Next select the funtion
    *Lastly chose the second number

If I had more time I would add more functions that are used in a complex calculator.

    *Complex Numbers
    *Logs with Different Bases
    *Factorials
